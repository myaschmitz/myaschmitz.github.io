(Required) Two kinds of objects created for this assignment:
1. Space Shuttle-1* - a space shuttle loaded from a GLTF file that randomly chooses planets to fly to
2. Asteroid-958* - asteroid with custom shaders that exist in a belt

(Required) Five other kinds of objects that you created (possibly in previous assignments):
3. Sun* - the sun in our solar system made with custom shaders
4. Moon* - the moon as a textured sphere with various defined maps
5. Mercury* - Mercury as a textured sphere with various defined maps
6. Venus - Venus as a textured sphere with various defined maps
7. Earth* - Earth as a textured sphere with various defined maps

(Optional) Backup Objects (more objects that you created, in case the ones above don't count):
- Mars - Mars as a textured sphere with various defined maps
- Jupiter* - Jupiter as a textured sphere with various defined maps
- Saturn - Saturn as a textured sphere with various defined maps
- Uranus (kind of far away, need to look closer to see it better) - Uranus as a textured sphere with various defined maps
- Neptune (kind of far away, need to look closer to see it better) - Neptune as a textured sphere with various defined maps
- Pluto (kind of far away, need to look closer to see it better) - Pluto as a textured sphere with various defined maps
- Space Station* - a space station orbiting around Earth loaded from a GLTF file

At least one of each type of object:
Building/structure: Space Station* - a space station structure rotating around Earth
Vehicle: Space Shuttle-1* - a space shuttle randomly traveling from planet to planet)
Natural Element: Earth* - Earth orbiting around the sun

Object loaded from a model file:
Model: Space Station* - a space station loaded from an FBX file 

An object with a shader that you wrote:
ShaderObj: Sun* - created using a custom animated shader

Other Objects that you would like to note:
- All of the other asteroids that were created procedurally.
